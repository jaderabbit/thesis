\section{Chapter~\ref{chap:first}: Swarm Robotics}
\label{sec:symbols:swarmrobotics}

\begin{description}
\setlength{\itemsep}{-1mm}
	\item[\parbox{\namewidth}{$p1$}] The probability that a robot will changed from rest to searching is adapted upon return to the sink and from deposit to rest.
	\item[\parbox{\namewidth}{$R$}] The set of tasks that can be performed by individuals of the swarm.
	\item[\parbox{\namewidth}{$\gamma$}] An individual robot in a swarm.
	\item[\parbox{\namewidth}{$\nu$}] A task such that $\nu \in R$
	\item[\parbox{\namewidth}{$r_{\gamma,\nu}$}] A response threshold for of robot $\gamma$ for task $\u$
	\item[\parbox{\namewidth}{$z$}] The probability of a robot to switch from search behaviour to rest behaviour.
	\item[\parbox{\namewidth}{$\gamma$}] An individual robot in a swarm.
