\chapter{Results}
\label{chap:results}

In order to evaluate the the algorithms, analysis is organised around three major characteristics of swarm robotics algorithms, namely flexibility, robustness and scalability. Section~\ref{overview} focuses on providing a general overview of algorithm performances, while flexibility of the algorithms over different environmental types and configurations is analysed in Section~\ref{results:flexibility}. The robustness to environmental changes is analysed in Section~\ref{results:robustness} while Section~\ref{results:scability} does a limited exploration of scalability. Section~\ref{results:summary} summarizes the findings of the experimentation.

The desert ant, honey and na\"ive foraging algorithms are compared for various robot configurations over various environments. In order to compare two experiments, two one-tailed Wilcoxin tests are performed where the first test determines if the samples in algorithm A are greater than the samples in algorithm B - which is counted as a win and the second test determines if the samples in algorithm A are less than the samples in algorithm B - which is counted as a loss. In order to get an idea of an algorithms performance against the other algorithms, the wins and losses per experiment are counted per algorithm. This statistical analysis approach has been used in \cite{helbig2013performance}. Table \ref{summarytable} shows the sum of the wins and losses per algorithm.

The pairwise Wilcoxon tests indicate that there exists a significant difference between the results of all three foraging algorithms. Desert ant foraging performed better than na\"ive foraging showing the positive effect of site fidelity. The honey bee algorithm out-performed the na\"ive foraging algorithm and desert ant algorithm indicating the positive effect of communication and adaptivity of the honey bee foraging algorithm. The standard deviation is high for all algorithms due to the extremely large variations in the environments provided.

However, these are results for all algorithms over all configurations of robot specialization and thus comparison is premature. In order to perform a real comparison between algorithms, the robot specialization parameter $\tau$ should be optimized in the potential event that there exists an initial configuration for $\tau$ that performs best across all environment types and robot configurations addressed in the analysis. 


\section{Flexibility}
\label{results:flexibility}

In real life environments, it's rarely feasible to optimize parameters per the environment in which a swarm of robots needs to be introduced. As a result, it's important that swarm robotics algorithms are insensitive to types of environment and either have a set of parameters that generalize well or have the ability to adapt their parameters to an unseen environment.

In order to determine the flexibility of the three proposed foraging algorithms, the effect of the ratio of item types in the environment as well as the effect on different types of distributions of gold and waste items in the environments is analysed. The more insensitive an algorithm is to the change in environmental parameters, the more flexible the algorithm can be considered to be.

Environment item ratio refers to the ratio of prioritized items to non-prioritized items $r$. In order to truly analyse the effects of the environment, one should optimize each algorithm for all the environments as there may exist a parameter set for the algorithms that performs well over all environments. For this reason, we first analyse two hypotheses related to the dependency of the performance of an algorithm in environments with a particular item ratio and the ratio of specialization of the robots themselves.

\subsubsection{The Relationship between Item Ratio in Environment and Specialization Ratio of Robots}
\label{relationship}

The next section addresses the following hypotheses:
\begin{enumerate}
\item An algorithm that forages a portion of non-prioritized items will have greater performance than an algorithm that does not forage any non-prioritized items.
\item Algorithm performance depends on the $r$ as well as $\tau$ and that as $r$ increases, the value of $\tau$ that yields the greatest value of $\sigma$, $\tau_{best}$, will increase approximately linearly for the na\"ive and desert ant algorithms, while the performance of the honey bee algorithm will be independent of $r$ due to division of labour.
\end{enumerate}

An algorithm configured with $\tau=1$ indicates that only prioritized items are foraged. By analysing Table \ref{ratio}, for the na\"ive and desert ant algorithms, for all values of $r$ where $r \neq 1$, $\tau_{best}$ is never equal to $1$, the hypothesis that the algorithms achieved the best performance when some robots are configured to forage non-prioritized items is true. The result is likely because non-prioritized items are moved out of the way to allow for easier, faster access to prioritized items or allow access to inaccessible prioritized items.

Fig \ref{desertantplot} shows the region in parameter space where the desert ant algorithm performs the best. The na\"ive and desert ant algorithms performed best when $\tau$ was slightly greater than $r$. The existence of the relationship motivates the development of an algorithm that adapts $\tau$ to correspond the environment item ratio $r$.

\subsubsection{Independence of the Honey Bee Foraging Algorithm to Item Type Ratio}
\label{Adaptability}

Analysis of Table \ref{ratio} indicates that the honey bee foraging algorithm has similar performance throughout all configurations for $r$ and $\tau$, which highlights that the performance of the honey bee algorithm is independent of the configuration of $\tau$, resulting in an algorithm that is potentially more flexible and robust. This could mean that the honey bee algorithm could perform well in dynamic environments where robots and items can be destroyed.

However, according to Table \ref{ratio}, the desert ant algorithm performs better than the honey bee algorithm, for particular configurations of $r$ and $\tau$. This indicates that, if the value of $r$ is known for a particular environment, then it is beneficial to use desert ant foraging and choose $\tau$ appropriately. A possible reason why the desert ant algorithm performs better when optimally configured for a particular environment than the honey bee algorithm is that the honey bee algorithm takes time to adapt to the environment, while the desert ant algorithm with optimal configurations has no division of labour overhead and may outperform the honey bee algorithm under those circumstances.

\end{figure}


It is possible that the algorithms will perform differently on different types of environments by exploiting their capabilities to memorize and communicate the location of areas with a high prioritized item density or conversely by using their exploration abilities to find new items. The performance of the algorithms is analysed over the different types of environments. The following hypotheses are explored:  

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The na\"ive foraging algorithm will perform better on environments with a uniform distribution compared to the clustered, the vein and Gaussian environments, due to the algorithms inability to return to areas with high item density. 
	\item The desert ant foraging algorithm will perform better on clustered, Gaussian and vein environments environments due to the ability to remember locations.
	 \item The honey bee foraging algorithm will perform best on Gaussian distribution environments since it will be able to recruit members to explore and forage even quicker than the desert ant. Honey bee will likely perform worse on the uniformly distributed environments as there may be time wasted to recruit robots to areas which do not especially contain prioritized items.

%Discussion
As indicated in \ref{objectgoldplot}, all algorithms are shown to degrade quite heavily as the items density increases. This is to be expected as it will take longer for robots to move and explore a larger environment. Thus the degradation of performance can likely be attributed to the limit on simulation time which should have been extended in order to cater for the large environments. Unfortunately, to adequately compare and analyse the performance as environment size increases one would have to allow more time over all to simulations.

\section{Robustness}
\label{results:robustness}

%Intro discussion



\subsection{Specialization}
\label{results:specialization}

The reason the initial robot specialization has been included under robustness is that the more dependant the algorithm is to robot specialization, the more sensitive  the algorithm is to robots becoming damaged. When referring to specialization in this chpater, it is referring specifically to the initial specialization ratio of the robots.

\label{divisionwasteplot}
\end{figure}

%Discuss Naive
An examination of Figure~\ref{divisiongoldplot} and Figure~\ref{divisionwasteplot} reveals some surprising observations.
As was discussed in Section~\ref{results:flexibility}, the overall trend is that as the ratio of robots foraging the prioritized type increases, the performance of the na\"ive algorithm increases. An interesting observation is that a robot specialization ratio $r=0.8$ results in the best performance for the na\"ive foraging aglorithms, while $r=1$, where all robots are foraging prioritized items, has slightly less effective performance. This can be attributed to the fact that foraging a portion of non-prioritized items benefits the algorithm.

%Discuss Desert Ant
The desert ant algorithm shows similar trends to the na\"ive algorithm with performance peaking around $r=0.8$ while the honey bee algorithm is consistent over specialization, indicating that the honey bee algorithm does indeed perform division of labour to some level of adequacy. The desert ant does however outperform the honey bee algorithm on most of the configurations. There is space for the honey bee algorithm to be optimized so to more adequately compare the algorithms, one would have to optimize the parameters. 
The performance of desert ant algorithm is interesting since there exists a configuration for $r$, $r=0.8$ that results in the best performance, independent of all environment types. That performance is better than the honey bee performance which means that a swarm of robots running the desert ant algorithm with the correct specialization ratio of robots will perform better than a honey bee algorithm at any robot specialization. 

The desert ant algorithm, however, is less robust since if an event causes a change in robot specialization ratio (for example robots becoming damaged in a rock fall), the performance of the desert ant algorithm will be affected by the change in ratio, where as the honey bee algorithm performance would remain constant due to the division of labour and it's attempts to optimize (albeit sub-optimally) the specialization ratio of robots. 

The result does make one wonder why none of the other graphs reflect the fact that the honey bee algorithm is outperformed by the desert ant algorithm. The other results and graphs in this study are most likely skewed by the experiments when $r=0$ where no desert ant robots can forage prioritized items and thus when examining results aggregated over a different parameter, the results are skewed. One should note that since the study is not focused on a comparison of performance of the various foraging algorithms, but rather an exploration in parameter sensitivity, the relative performance of the algorithms to each other is not important, however it is still an interesting result considering that since the honey bee agents can share information as well as divide their labour appropriately. 
 
Some possible reasons why the desert ant algorithm may outperform the honey bee algorithm are that:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The honey bee division of labour does not perfectly divide labour between the item types.
	\item Honey bee algorithm has a limiting factor such as one of the unoptimized parameters $f_{max}$ and $t_{max}$. 
	\item The process of the division of labour is slowing down the algorithm to some degree.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Scalability}
\label{results:scability}
Scalability is a key feature of swarm robotics. In order to examine the scalability of the proposed foraging algorithms, the performance of algorithms is compared over robot densities. 

\subsection{Robot Density}

%Discussion
The purpose of examining the effect of additional robots is to determine whether the addition of extra robots negatively effects an algorithm's performance. An algorithm that would scale perfectly would show a linear increase in performance as the number of robots increases. The addition of more robots could potentially create interference between the robots or cause malfunction of the algorithms and impacting scalability. 
% The addition of more robots creates interference between the robots or causes malfunction within the algorithms thus impacting scalability. 

The hypothesis is that the honey bee algorithm would be the least impacted by the increase in robot density since the robots will rest if they have not foraged an item for a particular period and thus the an increase in robots would not cause as much of an increase in interference. One needs to take care when selecting the environments for analysis. In order to confirm that any analysis about the slow down in the rate of foraging is caused by the increase in robot density, one should only analyse environments where the robots are unable to complete foraging of all items for all robot densities. For this reason, the analysis has only been performed over a high object density where all items were not able to be foraged at all item density. 

Figure~\ref{robotswasteplot} displays the fitted logarithmic line, the equation of the trend-line and the value of the coefficient of determination, $r^2$, is shown. The honey bee algorithm has the smallest error when fitting a linear line and has the steepest slope on the fitted logarithmic line which means it is the least negatively affected by the increase in robots. The desert ant is similar followed by desert ant soon after and na\"ive foraging being the most effected by an increase in robots. %TODO-PLOT THAT

%Why?
%The lower b is, the slower the rate at which the algorithm degrades as robot density increases

\subsection{Energy}
\label{results:energy}

%GET THIS GRAPH
Since energy usage was not the focus of this study, the process of assigning and monitoring energy usage to the various foraging tasks was not performed and was not considered a major metric for this study. However it is worth mentioning that the honey bee algorithm does have some waiting time where less or no energy would be spent, where as the na\"ive and desert ant algorithms do not save energy by going into a hibernation or resting state. It is thus potentially worth analysing the amount of time that the robots spend waiting at the sink in the honey bee algorithm to see if energy saving actually occurred due to active to inactive forager division of labour capabilities of the honey bee algorithm. 

One would expect the amount of time spent waiting to increase as robot density increases and the environment becomes saturated by robots since more robots would fail to find items and return to the waiting state. The graph indicates that a surprisingly small amount of time was spent waiting at the sink regardless of the robot density which tends to imply that there is room for improvement in the active to inactive forager division of labour strategy such that robots are more inefficient robots. 

One should also keep in mind that although this seems to imply that the honey bee algorithm performs more efficiently, the comparison is quite limited since the task of direct communication is likely to, in practice, be a very expensive activity energy-wise.

As the environment size increases, one would expect the performance to get quadratically less since the algorithms were run for the same amount of time. For this analysis, the experiments would ideally be run until no more items can be foraged, but due to time constraints only a limited study could be performed. For this reasons, the results have been presented however no valid analysis can be performed.


Analysing each algorithm individually a few observations are evident:
- The honey bee algorithm seems to be the least scalable since the jump in performance between the smallest environment of 50x50 cells and the environment that is next largest - the 100x100 cells is larger than either of the other two algorithms. This can likely be attributed to the fact that honey bee model that the algorithm was based on requires us to define the maximum time spent exploring for items, $f_{max}$ which will favour search close to the hive. The parameter $f_{max}$ is set far to low to work adequately in large environments. These parameters could likely be optimized for the large environments. What this shows is that the honey bee algorithm is sensitive to increases in environment size and thus less scalable and flexible since it requires extra optimization. In future, a probability-based technique could be used to slowly increase the probability of stopping a search as time increases. 

Performance of the desert ant algorithm is the least affected by size of the environment.(quote some figures). This is likely because the desert ant algorithm does not have the same parameters that limit the depth of exploration where as honey bee does. Thus desert ant wins at scalability due to less parameters. 


%Compare each one to how it should have performed - so that each algorithm gets a trendline.
%Think about how the number of robots increases
% 50 = 50 x 50 = 2500. 
% 100 = 100^2 = 10000 performance should be 25% of that of 50x50. but has twice as many robots as 50 and thus...
% 200 = 200^2 = 40000 performance should be 25% of that of 100x100 but has twice as many robots as 100 and thus... 
% 300 = 300^2 = 90000 performance should be 44% of that of 200x200 but has a 3rd more robots as 200
% 500 = 500^2 = 250000 performance should be 36% of that of 300x300 but has 2/5ths more robots than 300
