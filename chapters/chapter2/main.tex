\section{Definition}
\label{sec:second:definition}

In swarm robotics, robot foraging has become a benchmark problem due to its complex nature involving the coordination of numerous sub-tasks. The problem was initially addressed by biologists, particularly in the foraging behaviour of ants \cite{holldobler1990ants,bernstein1974seasonal}, bees \cite{seeley2009wisdom} and bacteria \cite{resnick1994turtles}. Foraging has a variety of real-life applications such as search and rescue \cite{jennings1997cooperative,murphy2000biomimetic}, and waste clean-up \cite{balch1995io}. Numerous swarm robotics algorithms have been developed to improve robustness, time and energy efficiency of the foraging process for multiple variations of the foraging problem as outlined in \cite{winfield2009foraging}. 

Foraging is the act of searching for and collection (or capturing) food for storage and consumption \cite{winfield2009foraging}. Foraging is an important problem that was first addressed by biologists in the examination of nature, particularly with the foraging behaviour of ants and bacteria. In a robot context, foraging is defined as the search and collection of scattered objects in an environment and returning those objects to a collection point.

The foraging sub-tasks involve the efficient search and collection of food, homing whilst carrying food to the nest site and then deposition of the food item in the nest before returning to foraging. Effective foraging requires co-operation using signals or direct cooperation of individuals in order to transport food items too large for individual transport. The foraging process has been adapted for numerous foraging problems and for different types of robots and is often replaced completely with more complex models, including communication components and division of labour.

\section{Biological Inspiration}

As with many swarm robotics problems, the inspiration comes from nature - in particular, social insects such as Ants and Honeybees. This section describes the biological models that are used in the algorithms derived by this thesis. 

\label{sec:second:biological}

\subsection{Ants}
%Ants
The study of ants has revealed that impressive emergent activities can be achieved with  simple agents with only a few simple rules. Ants use a form of communication known as stigmergy \cite{dorigo2000ant}. Stigmergy is where ants deposit a substance known as pheromone on the paths between the nest and the food source. Other ants can detect this pheromone and will tend to follow paths which have greater amount of pheromone deposits. Ant stigmergy has been modelled in numerous swarm intelligence techniques such as ant colony optimization and ant systems \cite{dorigo2006ant, dorigo2010ant}. 
 
Although algorithms based on ant foraging behaviour are used to solve optimization problems, the algorithms are often difficult to replicate in a real-life robotic environment since most of the techniques need to model stigmergy. A robotics algorithm that uses pheromone requires robots to be equipped with a substance-distributor, beacon-deployer or complex communication that simulates pheromone \cite{hoff2010two}.

%TODO: Mention each other the pheromone using robotic techniques - a review so to say. 

The desert ant (\textit{Cataglyphis bicolor}) does not make use of stigmergy to forage, as pheromone deposited on desert sand would be blown away by the wind. Instead, desert ants use a technique called path integration for navigation to relocate food sources that have already been found by random exploration \cite{collett1998local,wehner2003desert} as illustrated by Fig. \ref{pathintegration}. An overall heading and distance from the nest is maintained as the desert ant explores. As a result, a shortcut back to the nest is calculated in order to minimize heat stress. A human would solve this problem using vector addition, however ants have been shown to use a simpler approximation, which performs adequately, despite the addition of noise \cite{muller1988path}. Path integration (PI), more commonly known as dead reckoning, is a key evolutionary aspect gained from living in the hot barren desert. When path integration fails, the ant resorts to using landmarks, such as the sun, for navigation \cite{collett1998local}. 

\begin{figure} [h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{chapters/chapter2/figures/PathIntegration.pdf}
	\caption{Path Integration }
	\label{pathintegration}
\end{figure}

Due to the lack of pheromone, the desert ant is thus simpler to model for real-robot interaction. Desert ant foraging has been modelled in \cite{moller1998modeling,hecker2012formica,}. Hecker et al \cite{hecker2012formica} performed experiments using a small set of robots in a small arena on different environment types where two algorithms were evaluated: one based on the desert ant foraging and one including pheromone-like communication. It was shown that communication improved performance; however, the desert-ant algorithm still performed comparatively well. 

\subsection{Honey bee}

Bees have an impressive set of abilities considering the simplicity a single individual. They have the ability to remember colour and shape of flowers \cite{zhang2006honeybee} and in terms of navigation, they are able to learn local features and routes due to well-developed learning and memorizing capacities \cite{menzel2001cognitive}. Honey-bees are even time aware \cite{moore1989influence}. 

Similarly to ants, honey bees have efficient division of labour between different functions in the hive such as foraging and brood-care. Within foraging itself, honey bees perform division of labour specific to the foraging roles. Honey bee foraging is made up of three different roles \cite{seeley2009wisdom} namely employed foraging, unemployed foraging and scouting. Scouts explore the environment to locate new food sources. Once a source has been found, scouts return to the hive to communicate information about the located food source. To communicate the foraging information, scout bees perform a waggle-dance on the hive, containing information about the distance and bearing of the resource. The communication of a good foraging site is known as recruitment. 

Unemployed foragers wait on the dance floor, evaluating the dances of the scout bees. An unemployed bee chooses a location described by the scout bees, and becomes an employed forager. Employed forager bees use the information about the resource, attempt to locate the source, load themselves with food and return to the hive where unemployed foragers are ready to offload the food. Jansen \cite{janson2007searching} suggests that unemployed bees become exploring scouts when they do not detect any dancing scout bees. 

\section{Other}
\label{otherforaginginspirations}
%Not sure where to put this but I think it deserves a mention
Foraging is modelled in the swarm intelligence field. Besides ants and bees, other creatures are also looked to for inspiration.

The foraging behaviour of $E. coli$ bacteria is used for inspiration for a computational intelligence algorithm \cite{passino2010bacterial} and particle swarm optimization is, for instance based on the flocking behaviour of birds - a flocking behaviour exhibited when finding food, amongst other things \cite{kennedy1995particle}. 

The predator prey models could also be considered a foraging task with items with changing position. These models are often used with other swarm intelligence techniques, for use in multi-objective optimization problems \cite{nolfi1998coevolving}.


\section{Types of Robot Foraging}
\label{sec:second:types}

Foraging is a popular problem due to the vast opportunity for application. The foraging problem has been adapted into many different variations. Thus it is beneficial to present a taxonomy of robot foraging that can used to classify existing research about foraging as well as contextualize the specific foraging problems addressed by this thesis. Multiple taxonomies have been developed as robot foraging research has progressed \cite{oster1978caste,ostergaard2001emergent}, however a more recent taxonomy is presented in \cite{winfield2009foraging} which presents and discusses a much more complete foraging taxonomy. The taxonomy classifies foraging solutions based on characteristics of four major axes: the foraging environment, robots used for foraging, performance aspects and the foraging strategy used. Each of these major axes have a number of minor categories which are outlined in the table below.  

The environment classification axis includes addressing aspects such as search space itself, the type and placements of objects as well as the quantity of sinks. The robot aspect refers to qualities such as  the quantity of robots along with the robot's sensory, power and actuation capabilities. The performance axis characterises robot foraging on the the goal of the research such as energy gained or time taken to forage. The strategy axis characterizes algorithms by how the algorithm goes about solving the foraging problem.

\section{Challenges in Foraging}
\label{challengesinforaging}
%TODO: Expand on challenges in foraging. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Physical - Despite how far robotics has come as a field, there are still tasks that are trivial for humans, but still very complex for most robots. For instance, challenge of picking up items and moving them to another location requires a fair amount of research, decent quality sensors and time-consuming amount of calibration. 
\item Environmental - Although research can be performed in a controlled environment, for foraging to truly occur in real-life, environmental factors have to be taken into consideration. Environmental factors such as light, moisture, quality of the surface the robots forage on, often make a robotic solution a complex, non-viable, non-robust or expensive operation. 
\item Search with local sensors - Since global sensors such as GPS location can't always be used in all environments, the problem of how to find items with or without a global view of the environment and how to effectively guide the search optimally becomes an important issue. The fact 
\item Localization - The ability for a robot can depict their position on the environment
\item Energy - Energy conservation and   
\end{itemize}

\section{Foraging Algorithms}

%Insect Inspired
%----------------------------
Insects swarms are used as inspiration throughout swarm robotics due to their robust and flexible nature. Ants utilize pheromones which is a robust strategy for local interactions and would prove useful in hazardous environments. Section \ref{sec:second:natureinspired} discusses nature-inspired foraging algorithms

\subsubsection{Ant-inspired Foraging Algorithms}

%Blazing a trail => Nice paper - need to discuss more. Maybe in navigation
Vaughan presents a swarm robotic algorithm allowing for robust transportation of items from a single source to a single sink in an environment with spatial constraints \cite{vaughan2000blazing}. The algorithm presented makes use of both ant-like and bee-like foraging techniques. The ants broadcast the landmarks in the area for odometric localization as well as uses a form of the  honey bee "waggle dance" that communicates the direction of the food source from the robot that has found the food source to other robots. The robots use a technique called path integration utilized by both ants and bees in order to maintain position and heading estimate. Using these techniques the robots communicate multi-segment paths. These communications occur globally. This technique suffers from accumulation of localization errors over time due to the use of global communication. Local communication is preferred for the algorithms developed in this study.   %Our robot algorithms can reaign the sink %citations required!!!! %necessary? Worth a mention. 


%ANTS%
Hoff \cite{hoff2010two} classifies different types of ant-inspired pheromone-based foraging algorithms by how the pheromones are represented: physical marks \cite{alcoholfromants2012}, use of existing communication channels such as sharing over wireless networks as well as virtual pheromone. %Read further

%DoL in a Group of Robots Inspired by Ants Foraging Behaviour - Labella + Dorigo
Labella et al \cite{labella2006division} propose a foraging model inspired by the foraging of ants, where individual robots adapt to the environment using only locally available information. The adaption allows for effective division of labour to occur. The probability $p1$ that a robot will changed from rest to searching is adapted upon return to the sink and from deposit to rest. If a robot fails to forage any prey after searching for a specified maximum time, then the robot returns and rests. 
The adaption rule increases or decreases $p1$ by a constant $\Delta$ that is multiplied by the number of consecutive successes or failures. The study showed that adaption improved the amount of time spent not at rest. The advantage to this type of algorithm is its simplicity as no communication is required to regulate the number of robots. As pointed out, there is a global negative effect on overall efficiency at large group sizes. This is to be expected, but is not a serious problem since less energy is used, and this would be an advantage when energy is a scarce resource. %rephrase%
%Different from the problem proposed in this study as different priorities of items are not considered
%Come back and do a bit later.

\end{figure} 

Hoff \cite{hoff2010two} proposes a two ant-based foraging algorithm which do not require marking the physical environment. Instead, robots themselves become pheromone markers. The algorithms differ in the manner in which the beacon-to-pheromone role is chosen. 

Virtual pheromone algorithm functions as follows: Two pheromone trails are created - one trail from the source to the food and another trail from the source to the nest. The trail is created by robots: During execution, robots stop exploration and become pheromone beacons. The pheromone beacon robots simply broadcast a floating point number known as virtual pheromone. 
Local direct communications are used to transmit the virtual pheromone value.

The second technique uses cardinality where if a robot can hear 2 or more beacons then the robot stays a walker else the robot becomes a beacon. 
%Etc etc add more from paper!!!!

The advantage of using this technique over the other mentioned pheromone techniques is that robots are simpler due to simpler communication mechanisms as well as the lack of need for complex beacon deployment systems. Experiments are conducted with and without obstacles and a real-world simulator is used. The result show that congestion effects performance the most at high robot density. %write more in more detail. The cardin

\subsubsection{Bee-inspired Foraging Algorithms}
Bee swarms have been used in swarm robotics for problems such as path planning \cite{lin2009chaotic}, aggregation \cite{kernbach2009re}, collective perception \cite{schmickl2007collective}.%Relevant? Not sure. 

%TODO: Explain each example application
Foraging algorithms have been developed that simulate a simplified honey bee recruitment in \cite{alers2014biologically}, which focuses on an actual robot demonstration of the technique using a turtle robot. Prior work focuses on implementing the same algorithm on e-pucks. The algorithm consists of two phases: an exploratory phase followed by an exploitive phase. Initially, all robots are located around the hive. In the exploratory phase, all robots perform a random search with a levy distribution until a food source is found by a robot. The exploitation phase begins where the robot that located the food returns to the hive and communicates the location to other members of the robot swarm. The other robots are recruited and begin to commute between the hive and the food source, transporting virtual food. This algorithm claims to exhibit three behaviours of bees: waiting around the hive, exploring the environment and foraging. Unlike bees, the algorithm used does not consider the division of labour between foragers, explorers and waiting robots, but rather uses an extremely simple model for bees which can only exploit a single food source. The robots use path integration in order to remember the location of the food source, and use a northstar type navigation in order to locate the hive. The path integration vector gets communicated to the other robots which use the vector to guide them to the food source. 

tep 1: located around hive.
step 2: start to explore
step 3: robot finds food.

step 1: Robot returns food to hive.

\subsection{Other Algorithms}
\label{sec:second:otheralgorithms}
%TODO: Introduction to subsection

\subsection{Standard foraging}


%Fotan & Mataric
Schneider \cite{schneider1998territorial}, in order to reduce the interference caused by collisions, develop an algorithm to split the foraging environment into bounded areas for which a robot is in charge of. The sink area of one robot is the source area for the next, resulting in the emergence of bucket brigading behaviour. The bucket brigading algorithm is not suitable to environments where the size of the environment is not known - unless an algorithm is developed that will effectively allow a swarm of robots to divide the area. The algorithm is thus not suitable for comparison for the current study. The failure of a robot induces readjustment of territories in order to effectively cover the foraging area. Global information about the environment is used and as a result the algorithm is not suitable for comparison. %Reread to figure out if initial distribution algorithm exists

%Mataric
\O stergaard \cite{ostergaard2001emergent} determines that there is a finite number of any particular type of robot that is optimal for performing a foraging task. Mataric compares the algorithm to a naive algorithm which represents the baseline foraging task with no improvements. The naive algorithm in the thesis as a baseline comparison measure and is discussed in more detail in further chapters. Mataric found that if too many robots were allocated to the environment then extreme amounts of interference occurred which decreased the performance of the algorithm. Emergent bucket brigading was shown to perform better than naive in highly constrained environments however naive performed better in open environments. Algorithms are tested in environments of differing difficulties. %Need to read this paper to check which one these details came from. Also DO the thing for his name


%Goldberg + Mataric
Goldberg and Mataric \cite{Goldberg01designand} address the foraging problem with multiple sources and sink areas in an open field environment. The study focuses on interference reduction by making use of a dominance hierarchy - only the dominant robot near the sink can take an item to the sink. %mentioned PACK foraging. read up

%Mataric and Werger
Mataric \cite{werger1996robotic} and Werner discuss produced an algorithm where chains of robots are formed and the robots forage in circular excursions. The length of the change is then adusted according to the amount of food found by the foragers. %No idea how this works - read up. 
 
%Swarming Robots: Foraging Behaviour of Simple Multi-Robot System
Sugawara \cite{sugawara2002swarming} implements a foraging solution for a single food source. The algorithm is based on naive foraging however utilizes simple communication. A robot will stay and broadcast a light signal on finding an item. Other robots are attacted to the light signal based on an angular velocity equation. This differs from the techniques used in this thesis as all food sources communicated with equal weight where as the quality of a food source is evaluated by the honey bee algorithm.

%Alexandre Campo 2006 - Efficient multi-foraging robotics
\subsection{Multi-foraging}
Multi-foraging is defined as a type of foraging problem where instead  multiple object types are required to be foraged. \cite{Balch99rewardand}. The types of objects can have different characteristics and can be collected together or separately.

%Adaptive DoL in Large-scale Minimalist MultiRobot systems - Mataric.
%2 types of items 
Jones et al \cite{jones2003adaptive} describe a version of the problem where there exist two types of items and items are consumed instead of transported to the sink and as items are consumed, the same type of item is placed at a random spot in the arena. Robots signal what type of item they are foraging by a coloured light which other robots use to build a local history of the number of robots they have seen that are allocated to each item type. A history of the number of observed items of each type is also collected. The division of labour capability is formed by estimating the current division of labour of the group by  using the described local observations. The estimations are then used to determine the probability of changing from foraging the current item type to the other type. 

%\begin{equation}
% P(Green - Red) = \left\ {
%	\begin{array} {l l}
%		(GR - GP_*(1-GP) & \quad \textrm{if GR \geq GP} \\
%		0, & \quad \textrm{otherwise}
%	\end{array}
% \right.
%\end{equation} 

%		(RR- RP)*(1-RP) & \quad \text{if RR $\geq RP$
%%%%DoL$
Campo \cite{campo2007efficient} performs a study in order to identify characteristics of efficient multi-foraging behaviour.  A mathematical model is developed and validated to predict optimal foraging behaviour and thus allows absolute evaluation of the proposed decision algorithm. The proposed foraging decision algorithm utilizes the amount of other robots encountered as well as the amount of prey encountered to only allocate enough robots foraging  so that remaining robots can spare energy. A measure is proposed that estimates the instantaneous energy that a robot group can gain, which each robot uses to guide the search process. 
%Need to add discussion
%Says prey

Balch \cite{balch1999impact} develops a technique for multi-foraging and determining the impact of robot diversity on multi-foraging performance. This thesis's does not consider robot diversity since robots are homogenous.

\section{Prioritized Foraging}
\label{sec:second:prioritizedforaging}

%Focus on the robots used, the model used and the experiments performed

The multi-foraging problem is a more complex version of standard foraging, where more than one type of item must be foraged to a separate sink \cite{balch1999impact}. That in mind, the prioritized foraging problem, shown in Fig.\ref{prioritizedforaging}, is defined as a modified version of the multi-foraging problem where an environment has two types of items: prioritized items and non-prioritized items. The goal is to forage all the items of the prioritized type. The possibility exists that prioritized items become trapped among non-prioritized items and thus the non-prioritized items need to be removed from the environment to clear an access route to the prioritized items. 

The prioritized foraging problem has increased difficulty due the fact that  foraging the non-prioritized item more than required will result in a waste of time and energy. The goal of research in prioritized foraging is to develop an algorithm to efficiently adapt the number of robots searching for prioritized items to those moving non-prioritized items out the way. 

The prioritized foraging problem is suitably applied to search and rescue. For example, in the case of a building collapsing, robots will need to get to the survivors as quickly as possible, however it is important that some robots move waste material in order to reach the trapped survivors. Prioritized foraging could be applied to the gold mining problem where the gold needs to be foraged as a priority and the waste needs to be moved out the way.

	\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{chapters/chapter2/figures/EpuckGoldMining.pdf}
	\caption{Prioritized Foraging Problem }
	\label{prioritizedforaging}
\end{figure}

As per Winfield's classification described in section \ref{sec:second:taxonomy}, the prioritized foraging problem has a constrained environment, multiple source areas with multiple sinks, multiple object types, object placement is tested in a number of environment types explained in the following sections. There are multiple homogenous robots with limited sensing, relative localisation with near communications and unlimited power. Power is kept as unlimited since the energy preservation of algorithms is to be studied as a performance measure.
