\begin{center}{\large\bf Abstract}\end{center}
Your thesis abstract goes here. This should be a single paragraph. Try to keep it as brief as possible (less than 200 words --- if this abstract page runs onto a second page, it needs shortening), while keeping in mind that it should touch on all the important aspects of your research --- consider whether someone unfamiliar with your research area would be able to determine whether your research is relevant to them, or not. Keep in mind that the abstract may be the only thing someone reads before choosing to either discard your work, or keep reading. Also, make sure that there are no references in the abstract. The keywords list should include no more than ten keywords. Keywords may be single words, or multi-word terms (such as ``neural networks'' or ``particle swarm optimisers''). When choosing keywords, consider terms that are descriptive of your research, and are likely to be used in search queries that should find your work.

\noindent\

\noindent{\bf Keywords:} First keyword, second keyword, final keyword.
